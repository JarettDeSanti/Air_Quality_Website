## Project 1 User Story:
As a person interested in exploring new places, I need to make sure that the weather condtions, including air quality are good, so my resouces of both time and money are invested in a positive experience and not wasted because of poor enviromental conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria:

Given a website that provides information on regional conditions related to weather and air quality:

When I view the opening page,

Then I'm presented with a clean and easy to navigate site, with the name of the website and several buttons that are labeled with the search topics like weather and air quality that I'm interested in.

When I choose a search topic,

Then I can easily use the provided form input to enter either the city or zipcode of the region I'm interested in.

When the search topic I've selected is weather,

Then I'm presented with the weather information, including the current conditions and a projected 5 - 10 day forcast for the city or region that I selected.

When the search topic I've selected is air quality,

Then I'm presented with the current AQI 'air quality index' and a map indicating the predicted AQI based on local conditions such as pollution or wildfire smoke. The forcast will be based on the projected prevailing wind patterns.
